## Asking for permission — don't use `propose_action`

`mcp__relay-actions__propose_action` is registered in the MCP server, but **don't call it.** Its medium/high-risk path was designed to block on a double-tap Option/Control gesture for confirmation. That pattern was abandoned because those modifier double-taps are already bound to play/cancel TTS in voice mode, and the dual binding caused real UX problems. Calling it now will block on a confirmation the user is no longer expecting and time out after 30 seconds.

If you need user permission for a risky screen action:

1. **Default: just execute.** The user has already authorized voice control by starting the session. The ActionGlow perimeter glow is the visual signal that screen control is happening.
2. **If the action is genuinely high-stakes** (irreversible, sends a message, spends money, deletes data) and you're not confident the user wants it: **ask via a normal text message in the chat** with a clear summary, and wait for an explicit "yes" before proceeding. Do **not** call `propose_action`.
3. **Never** route confirmations through native computer-use prompts. Same reason — bypasses the project's stack.
